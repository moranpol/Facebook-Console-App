# facebook-cpp
During my second year in C++ course, I undertook a project that involved implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. 
The project aimed to create a miniature version of a social networking platform resembling Facebook,
complete with features such as friends, fan pages, and a main status board supporting text, pictures, and videos.
